1.3 (2016-08-30)
================

Major Changes
-------------

- Remove the ``--tmp-dir`` flag from the command line (doctr now always
  deploys using a log file). (:issue:`92`)
- Python API: Change ``commit_docs`` to actually commit the docs (previously,
  it was done in ``push_docs``). (:issue:`92`)
- Python API: Don't sync files or get the build dir in ``commit_docs``. This
  is done separately in ``__main__.py``. The Python API for ``commit_docs`` is
  now ``commit_docs(*, added, removed)``. (:issue:`92`)

  files. (:issue:`92`)
- Support running doctr multiple times in the same build. (:issue:`93`, :issue:`95`)
- Add ``doctr deploy --command`` to allow running a command before committing
  and deploying. (:issue:`97`)
- Add ``doctr deploy --no-sync`` to allow disabling syncing (useful with
  ``doctr deploy --command``). (:issue:`97`)

Minor Changes
-------------

- Correctly commit the log file. (:issue:`92`)
- Fix sync_from_log to create dst if it doesn't exist, and add tests for this. (:issue:`92`)
